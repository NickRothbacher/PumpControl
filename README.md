# PumpControl
Simple program to manually control [open source syringe pump](http://www.appropedia.org/Open-source_syringe_pump)

Joystick control from [here](http://winkleink.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/raspberry-pi-unipolar-stepper-motors.html) and [here](https://github.com/qubecad/Pi_stick).

Joystick control works with both usb inputs and SPI inputs from analog to digital converters (e.g. MCP3008)
